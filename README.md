# Speaker-Recognition using GMM-UBM and I-vector
This project is MATLAB implementation of speaker recognition system with different identifier to choose from such as GMM, GMM-UBM and i-vector

STEPS:

1) Run Loading.m to load and extract the features of each audio file into MATLAB workspace.
2) Uses the Classifiers for Recognition.

Note: MATLAB toolbox "Soundbox" and microsoft i-vector toolbox should be included in MATLAB libraries
